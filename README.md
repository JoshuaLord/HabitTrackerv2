# Habit Tracker v2

## Description
A personal website developed to track daily and weekly habits through an auto-generated task system. 

## Motivation
Previously, Habit Tracker was implemented using raw JS and PHP code. I wanted to work with a familiar problem, but use new technologies including NoSQL databases, Express.js server-side framework, React.js client-side framework, Arch Linux, etc. 

## Technologies
* MongoDB       - v6.0.0
* Express.js    - v4.17.1
* React.js      - v17.0.2
* Node.js       - v16.7.0
